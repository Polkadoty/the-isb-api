# Guide: Converting Ship Cards to JSON

This guide explains how to convert Star Wars Armada ship cards into JSON format for use in our API and card reconstruction system.

## 1. Basic Structure

Start with the basic structure of a ship JSON object:

```json
{
    "ships": {
        "ship-name-in-kebab-case": {
            // Ship details go here
        }
    }
}
```

## 2. Chassis Information

Fill in the chassis information:

```json
"_id": null,
"type": "chassis",
"chassis_name": "ship-name-in-kebab-case",
"size": "small|medium|large|huge",
"hull": number,
```

- `_id`: Leave as null, it will be generated later.
- `type`: Always "chassis" for ships.
- `chassis_name`: The ship's name in kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens).
- `size`: "small", "medium", or "large". Flotilla are defined as a trait, not a size.
- `hull`: The hull value from the card.

## 3. Speed

Convert the speed chart to JSON:

```json
"speed": {
    "1": [number],
    "2": [number, number],
    "3": [number, number, number],
    "4": [number, number, number, number]
},
```

Fill in the numbers for each speed, using the values from the card's speed chart. Aka - is 0, I is 1, II is 2.

## 4. Shields

Add the shield values:

```json
"shields": {
    "front": number,
    "rear": number,
    "left": number,
    "right": number,
    "left_aux": number,
    "right_aux": number
},
```

Fill in the shield values for each section. Use 0 for sections that don't exist (like aux arcs on smaller ships).

## 5. Hull Zones

Add the hull zone information:

```json
"hull_zones": {
    "frontoffset": number,
    "centeroffset": number,
    "rearoffset": number,
    "frontangle": number,
    "centerangle": number,
    "rearangle": number
},
```

These are only for future reference. Do not worry about these for the moment.

## 6. Images

Add placeholders for silhouette and blueprint images:

```json
"silhouette": "[link to image]",
"blueprint": "[link to image]",
```

## 7. Ship Models

Create entries for each variant of the ship:

```json
"models": {
    "ship-variant-name": {
        // Ship variant details go here
    }
}
```

## 8. Ship Variant Details

For each ship variant, include the following information:

```json
    "author": "Publisher Name",
    "alias": "Publisher Abbreviation",
    "team": "Publisher Abbreviation",
    "release": "Release Wave",
    "expansion": "Expansion Name",
    "_id": null,
    "type": "ship",
    "chassis": "chassis-name",
    "name": "Full Ship Name",
    "faction": "faction-name",
    "unique": boolean,
    "traits": ["trait1", "trait2"],
    "points": number,
```

For example, for FFG I put:

```json
    "author": "Fantasy Flight Games",
    "alias": "FFG",
    "team": "FFG",
    "release": "Wave 0 Armada",
    "expansion": "Armada Core Set (SWM01)",
```

For AMG:

```json
    "author": "Atomic Mass Games",
    "alias": "AMG",
    "team": "AMG",
    "release": "Rapid Reinforcements I",
    "expansion": "Rapid Reinforcements I",
```

When putting the expansion name, use the release names mentioned in the Star Wars Armada wiki located here:
- https://starwars-armada.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Armada_Wiki

I just removed the "Print-and-play" from the names of Rapid Reinforcements I and II.

`flotilla` are defined as a trait here.
For the rest, see the following example for a victory star destroyer 1, for the empire:

```json
"models": {
    "victory-i-class-star-destroyer": {
        "author": "Fantasy Flight Games",
        "alias": "FFG",
        "team": "FFG",
        "release": "Wave 0 Armada",
        "expansion": "Armada Core Set (SWM01)",
        "_id": null,
        "type": "ship",
        "chassis": "victory-star-destroyer",
        "name": "Victory I-Class Star Destroyer",
        "faction": "empire",
        "unique": false,
        "traits": ["star-destroyer"],
        "points": 73,
```

## 9. Defense Tokens

Add the defense token information:

```json
"tokens": {
    "def_scatter": number,
    "def_evade": number,
    "def_brace": number,
    "def_redirect": number,
    "def_contain": number,
    "def_salvo": number
},
```

Set the value to the number of each token type the ship has.

## 10. Command Values

Add the command values:

```json
"values": {
    "command": number,
    "squadron": number,
    "engineer": number
},
```

## 11. Upgrade Slots

List the upgrade slots:

```json
"upgrades": ["slot1", "slot2", "slot3", ...],
```

For this section, just copy the upgrades in the json template here and delete the ones the ship doesn't have. Make sure these are named exactly:

```json
    "upgrades": ["commander", "officer", "weapons-team", "support-team", "fleet-command", "fleet-support", "offensive-retro", "weapons-team-offensive-retro", "defensive-retro", "experimental-retro", "turbolaser", "ion-cannon", "ordnance", "super-weapon", "title"],
```

## 12. Armament

Add the armament information:

```json
"armament": {
    "asa": [red, blue, black],
    "front": [red, blue, black],
    "rear": [red, blue, black],
    "left": [red, blue, black],
    "right": [red, blue, black],
    "left_aux": [red, blue, black],
    "right_aux": [red, blue, black],
    "special": [red, blue, black]
},
```

Fill in the number of dice for each color (red, blue, black) in each firing arc. Use 0 for colors or arcs that don't apply.

## 13. Card Images

Add placeholders for artwork and card images:

```json
"artwork": "",
"cardimage": ""
```


## Example

For reference, you can look at the Victory Star Destroyer JSON:

```typescript:public/converted-json/ships/victory-star-destroyer.json
startLine: 1
endLine: 160
```

This example shows how the Victory Star Destroyer card has been converted to JSON format following these guidelines.
